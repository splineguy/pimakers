# Summary

**EDIT: [1/13/17]** I've uploaded a new version with the teeth and tongue modified to print easier and hopefully come out better when casting.

The Wolf School medallion from the game *The Witcher III*. 

This model was designed to be printed in high resolution on a laser resin printer and many of the details will not show up at default scale on FDM printers.

The model measures *5.05 x 4.4 x 2.65 cm (1.98 x 1.73 x 1.04 inches)*

# Print Settings

# Post-Printing

## Molding

I used a high resolution print to make a silicone mold of the medallion. 

## Casting

I then made a cast of it from plastic mixed with aluminum powder. I Coated the inside of the mold with fine aluminum powder and mixed some powder into the liquid resin before pouring. If you are interested in the process I recommend googling "cold casting".

 I embedded a bent paperclip in the ring loop during the casting process to make it stronger.

## Finishing

I polished the part with super fine steel wool and a smooth, hard, metal object to give it a metallic appearance.
