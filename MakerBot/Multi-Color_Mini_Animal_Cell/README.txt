# Summary

We've shrunk down our popular [Multi-Color Cell Model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2485063) so that you can put it in your pocket and show it to your friends. Don't forget to tell them that the mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell!

Also, check out our [Multi-Color Mini Plant Cell](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2811554)!

While these were printed with Palette+ (http://MosaicMfg.com), the model has been designed so that you should be able to print these pieces separately and glue them together without too much difficulty.
